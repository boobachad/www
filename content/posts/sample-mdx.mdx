# heading 1

demonstrating how are mdx files parsed

## another heading this time 2nd

```javascript
console.log('Hello, mdx!');
```

### Adding Interactive Elements

now here we come with the cool part of mdx which is basically md+jsx wheere i can directly embed react components

Here's my newsletter signup form:

<NewsletterForm /> 

lets try a custom a button also

<CustomButton text="punch me" /> 

## Conclusion

<div style={{ padding: '20px', border: '2px dashed green', borderRadius: '8px', marginTop: '20px' }}>
  <p>earlier i talked about jsx. now i wote this div via jsx was written here in this file</p>
  <p>meaning now i can embed html elements</p>
<p>i can <span style={{color: 'blue'}}>also</span> use inline css</p>
</div>

Thanks for sticking around!
