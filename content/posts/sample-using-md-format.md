# heading 1

demonstrating how are md files parsed

## another heading this time 2nd

```javascript
console.log('Hello, md!');
```

### heading 3 

now what we did till heading 2 is the limit of md files

below are for comparison to the other mdx file

Here's my newsletter signup form(it will not show anything):

<NewsletterForm /> 

Let's add a custom button component.

<CustomButton text="Click Me!" /> 

### lets end this

<div style={{ padding: '20px', border: '2px dashed green', borderRadius: '8px', marginTop: '20px' }}>
  <p>there is not much styling u can do in the md.</p>
</div>

Thanks for sticking around!
