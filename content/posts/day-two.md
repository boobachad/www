what happens behind the scenes when we compile the code?

before compilation: code

during compilation :allocate ram as needed if encounters operation, operators, operands as needed are provided to ALU via i/o registers thorugh data bus after operation using gates in ALU it then again via data bus stores the output back to output registers.

after compilation: it becomes machine code

just before 8bit registration
